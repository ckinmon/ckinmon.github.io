            <h2>Caleb's Professional Experience</h2>
            <p>

            <h2>Caleb's Software Projects</h2>
            <p>
                Most of my experience and projects are academic in nature. I have written several APIs and applications in Java, including a game 
                that utilizes basic artificial intelligence techniques such that the computer player records the game history and identifies a human 
                player's biases. During my free time...
